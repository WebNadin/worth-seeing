This project works using API [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/).

Working version of website [here](http://worth-seeing.inf.ua/)
 Click on filter by genre or choose one of four raiting: more movies will apperar in the middle component.

 In this project I mastered:
 - React
 - react-create-app
 - react-router
 - styled-components
 - axios

 Design and markup was created by my own.
