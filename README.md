# Worth-seeing: the most popular films for your pleasure.

![Website working gif](https://github.com/WebNadin/worth-seeing/raw/master/film-search-service/readme-image.gif)

This project works using API [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/).

Working version of website [here](http://worth-seeing.inf.ua/)
 Click on filter by genre or choose one of four ratings: more movies will appear in the middle component.

 In this project I mastered:
 - React
 - react-create-app
 - react-router
 - styled-components
 - axios

 I created  design and markup by myself.


### Installation

This page requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

First you need to run next [Node.js API](https://nodejs.org/):
- clone branch `master` with `git clone https://github.com/PavelCreator/imdb-node-middleware-rest-api.git`
 ```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Great! Now you are able to start your work with the project.
All components are in the `src` folder. All other files were generated by `react-create-app`

You could follow next steps to deploy a local project:
 - clone branch `master` with `git clone https://github.com/WebNadin/worth-seeing.git` or fork it and then clone it
 from your forked repo

 ```
$ cd film-search-service
